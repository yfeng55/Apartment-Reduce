# Apartment-Reduce
Our project analyzes a dataset of New York City apartment listings pulled from the popular real estate listings sites in order to distinguish between spam/fraudulent listings and legitimately good values.

We run MapReduce jobs to compute neighborhood characteristics and filter out spam. From the filtered dataset, we identify good value apartment listings.
